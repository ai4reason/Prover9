Mace4 Changelog.

Most recent changes are at the top.

May 26, 2004.  Change iterate_up_to parameter to
allow a value of -1, which means to iterate forever.

May 26, 2004.  In ../ladr/formula.c, update the CNF
transformation, making it more efficient.  Prompted by
the May 18, 2004 bug.

May 18, 2004.  Release mace4-2004-C.

May 18, 2004.  Soundness bug from Geoff Sutcliffe.
CNF transformation.  This affects non-clausal input
only (formulas(...) in the input).  Since this is a
serious bug, a new release will be made today.

January 7, 2004.  Bug from Guy Erez.  Segfault if a domain
element is used as a propositional variable, as in the clause
"0.".  Fixed by checking for that case (and causing a fatal_error)
in collect_mace_syms.

November 20, 2003.  Fixed minor memory leak that shows up
when using iterate_up_to.

November 19, 2003.  Added flag iterate_primes.  When using
assign(iterate_up_to, n), set(iterate_primes) says to skip
the non-prime domain sizes.  The corresponding command-line
argument is -q1.

November 19, 2003.  Added parm increment (default 1).
When using assign(iterate_up_to, n), assign(increment, i)
does the obvious.  The corresponding command-line argument
is, for example, -i2.

November 11, 2003.  Added flag integer_ring.  This fixes the
operations [+,-,*] as the ring of integers mod domain_size.
The corresponding command-line argument is -R1.

October 17, 2003.  mace4-2003-B released.  This is the first
formal release of Mace4.

---(probably some unrecorded changes)---

October 28, 2004.  (Many changes to LADR)  Changed negation symbol
from ~ to -.  (Sorry.)  Changed simp_term in ground.c so that
- can be used as a function symbol as well as a logic symbol.

--- Further changes are listed in the LADR Changelog file (../Changelog).
