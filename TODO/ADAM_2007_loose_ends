1. Isofilter: quiet option, which removes "1000 interps" messages.

2. Prover9: automatic disabling of back subsumption at 500 given clauses
    can cause problems; make it an option?

3. LADR: give users the option of redeclaring built-in operations,
    e.g., redeclare(conjuntion, and) changes conjunction from
    the default "&" to "and".

4. Interpformat: New format so that models can be easily parsed
    by python, perl, etc.

5. Package manual and examples for offline Windows users.

6. Prover9: Rethink hints processing w.r.t. redundant hints.

That's quite a list already, and I'm definitely going to use most of
these added features. Here are a couple of longer term ideas that were
mentioned (and probably weren't meant to be on your specific
list). You probably remember them in some form, but since you asked...

-- Set up a (Media)Wiki for theory definitions in Prover9/Mace4 syntax

-- Make manual searchable

-- Elaborate some glossary entries (e.g. paramodulation) with notation
and (general) examples to make it easier to understand what Prover9 is
doing in a proof step

-- Incorporate isofilter into Mace4 at an appropriate point using the
notion of a canonical partial interpretation

-- Make Prover9/Mace4 available as an optional package in SAGE

Let me know when you have interpformat on the table, and
I'll send you a useful format for binary operations.

Similarly for Mace4. I have some ideas -- not difficult, I think --
which I couldn't articulate at the workshop.
